            <p>"Star Wars" captivated you from the moment Darth Vader stepped onto a transport vessel to capture Princess Leia. But this quiz isn't about all the memorable scenes the "Star Wars" series has brought you. This quiz digs deeper, much deeper. For example, do you remember how Princess Leia got her title "princess?"

                Can you remember which hand Luke loses while fighting his father in Cloud City? It might seem like an easy answer, but we're sure you'll have to think hard about it. Or, do you know the original title of the movie "Star Wars?"

                    The "Star Wars" franchise has thrown you from one adventure to the next with hundreds of memorable characters, amazing battle scenes, and gorgeous scenery. But, as the galaxy grows under Disney, how much do you really think you remember? You might remember the colors of BB8 and R2D2, but can you recall the color of Obi-Wan Kenobi’s lightsaber when he defeated Darth Maul? Or how many toes Yoda had in "The Phantom Menace?"
